## 🚀 Overview

StructuraAI is an autonomous construction planning intelligence system that converts structural blueprints into:

* Executable construction schedules
* Structural dependency graphs
* Conflict-aware execution strategies
* Risk propagation simulations
* Buildability scoring
* Interactive what-if optimization
* AI-backed engineering explanations

This is not a drawing viewer.
This is a **construction decision engine**.

All engineering logic is deterministic.
LLMs are used strictly for reasoning explanation — never computation.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### 🔹 Digital Structural Twin

Creates unified structural representation:

* Columns
* Beams
* Slabs
* Structural relationships

---

### 🔹 Dependency Intelligence (NetworkX)

Automatically constructs execution logic:

```
Foundation → Column → Beam → Slab
```

Generates:

* Task sequencing
* Critical path
* Parallel constraints

---

### 🔹 Multi-Strategy Planner

| Strategy       | Objective          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Fast Track     | Minimize duration  |
| Balanced       | Stable execution   |
| Cost Optimized | Reduce budget load |

Each recalculates duration, cost, and risk exposure.

---

### 🔹 Conflict Detection Engine ⭐

Detects:

* Curing overlap violations
* Workforce overload
* Dependency violations
* Parallel execution clashes

Prevents avoidable execution failure.

---

### 🔹 Risk Propagation Simulation

Simulates delay impact across dependency graph.

If one task shifts →
entire schedule recalculates.

True cascading logic.

---

### 🔹 Buildability Score™ ⭐

Executive metric:

```
f(dependency complexity,
  task overlap,
  risk density,
  resource load)
```

Example:

```
Buildability Score: 82 / 100
Status: Moderate Risk
```

Single-number execution intelligence.

---

### 🔹 What-If Optimization ⭐⭐⭐

Interactive sliders:

* Workforce variation
* Material delay
* Budget adjustment

Live recalculation of:

* Project duration
* Risk exposure
* Budget impact

---

### 🔹 AI Construction Consultant (Ollama)

LLM-powered reasoning layer:

* Strategy comparison
* Risk justification
* Buildability explanation
* Executive summary generation

Runs fully offline for data privacy.
